In this project I am trying to find out which type of product doing well in supermarket By customers rating and total revenue , and to identify  which category customers spends a lot by Gender(male and female) , also to identify that which type of product, suppliers should be focused on ( if any product sales is going down), to find out Which city is good for expansion by products and by quantity.



Conclusion:

1.Supermarket handle 4 cities and 4 branches, branch A is bit higher than other branches,
  Branch A is in Mumbai so Mumbai is the most profitable city and this city should be expansion.
2.Most popular payment method used by customers is credit card.
3.The ratings given by the customers did not affect the gross income 
4.Gross income is similar for both male and female but female customers spend a bit higher than male customers.
5.Home and lifestyle product quantity is high but health and beauty product quantity is low.
6.Females spend more on home and lifestyle and male spends more on  home and lifestyle + health and beauty +food and beverage.



The next step, supermarket should be focus on that product whose sales quantity is low So that their market has to be maintained.
